    <title>Amazing Cure for Floaters</title>

      <![CDATA[<h2>I was looking through some resources for essential oils and came across oils to use for "Floaters".  My mom had just mentioned she had one the day before!! I had no idea what a floater was before mom mentioned it.  A floater is a little black spot that "floats" around obstructing your vision.  My mom had gone to the optometrist and was told there was nothing they could do, so of course when I came across an essential oil recipe I asked my mom to just try it.  What did she have to lose on something that had no cure??!!! </h2>
<p>The recipe is simple - a drop of Lavender and a drop of Frankincense and dab it on the bones around the eye.  Mom did this 5-6 times per day.  She was amazed that she noticed some of the spots had disappeared after only a week!! So AWESOME!!!  </p>
<p>I love it when I find a new way to use essential oils.  There is so much to know so I love the <a href="https://www.myessentiallife.ca/collections/essential-oil-books-guides" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modern Essentials </a>resource book.  Then I have so much information right at the tip of my fingers!  After all, I cant possible remember it all!  </p>
<p>We would love to hear from you, contact us any time!!  Don't forget to check out our <a href="https://www.myessentiallife.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">store</a> to find some amazing essential oil stuff! </p>

    <title>Relieve Stomach Upset In One Easy Step</title>

      <![CDATA[<h2>Holiday weekends can wreak havoc on the digestive system and Easter is no exception!  This year we are traveling to see some family.  That will mean major overindulgence! </h2>
<p>First off, we are going to have 5 hours in our car, and that will most certainly mean car sickness for one or more of us.  My family will be very gracious hosts meaning all kinds of rich and delicious foods. Not to mention a glass or two of wine! To top off the weekend we will have a visit from the Easter Bunny, which I can only assume will mean loads of chocolate and candies for the kids....maybe, just maybe they will share with us! </p>
<p>To sum up how this weekend will go....we will have a ton of fun and laughs....and most certainly a ton of tummy troubles!! </p>
<p>Digestzen is our “go to” for any stomach troubles.  It contains Ginger, Fennel, Coriander, Tarragon, Anise, Caraway and Peppermint essential oils.  Combined together these oils ease stomach discomfort and aid in digestion and reduce gas and bloating. The perfect combination to help you through any tummy troubles!</p>
<p>This is an essential oil that comes with us everywhere!  We cannot live without it! I am always amazed at how fast it works, one or two drops is all it takes.  My husband and I take it internally, but the kids are not fans of the fennel taste so we dilute it with coconut oil in a roller bottle and rub it on their bellies.</p>
<p> I also love love love peppermint. We use a combo of oils, Peppermint beadlets and Digestzen softgels.</p>
<p>We would love to hook you up with some awesome oils.  You can shop <a href="https://www.myessentiallife.ca/pages/essential-oils" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> for them.  Need some roller bottles for easy on the go application for the kids?  Find everything you need <a href="https://www.myessentiallife.ca/collections/glass-bottles-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

      <![CDATA[<h2>“Moooooommm, I’m thirsty!!!”, the kids echo from the backseat right on cue!  Of course we are on the way to dance, and only 20 minutes away, but those little tummies in the back can’t possibly wait that long!</h2>
<p>In true mom fashion, I have a cooler full of healthy snacks and drinks ready to pass back. I grab a bottle of milk and unscrew the lid just a little to help out the little hands waiting impatiently for the drink in the back seat.  Just as I pass it back, I hit a tiny pothole in the highway and lose grip on the bottle....milk splashes all down the seat and into the floor mat! We all know that is going to smell like rotten baby puke before I get a chance to mop it all up! </p>
<p>Good thing I have my car diffuser attached to the vent...uggg ...I’m going to have to add a couple more drops of balance to ease my nerves to make it the rest of the way to dance, and get my mind off the nasty mess waiting for me when I get there!    </p>
<p>We just added some awesome car diffusers to our product list. Not only are they practical they are pretty too! We have three tree of life styles to choose from.  Amidst all the chaos in the backseat you can gaze down and take a deep breath to take in the beauty and aroma. They are super simple to use too, simply pop open the top and drop the oils on the felt pad, close it up and attach it to a vent.</p>
<p>So ladies and gentlemen, we have your back, another simple way to ease some of the stress of your day! </p>
<p>We would love to hook you up with some of these sweet diffusers.  Just click <a href="https://www.myessentiallife.ca/products/car-diffuser" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE</a> and we would also love love love to hear from you!! Contact us anytime!!</p>

<p>We use Doterra oils at our house and there are a couple blends already prepared that I could NEVER live without – On Guard for immune support and Zengest for stomach issues. </p>
<p>I found a couple of awesome roller blends to use for anyone who wants to mix up their own blends.</p>
<p>For Tummy Troubles try this Belly Blend</p>
<p>Try it in a sample size 5ml bottle.  Simply add 2 drops Coriander, 5 drops Fennel, 5 drops Ginger, 2 drops Orange, 5 drops Peppermint and top with Fractionated Coconut oil. </p>
<p>For immune support you can also try this great essential oil blend in a 5ml bottle.  Add 2 drops Cinnamon, 2 drops Clove, 3 drops Lemon, 3 drops Tea Tree, 2 drops Oregano, 3 drops Rosemary and top with Fractionated Coconut Oil.</p>
<p>Love these blends and want them in a 10 ml roller bottle?  Simply double the drops of each oil and with top fractionated coconut oil. </p>
<p>No bottles?  No problem!  We have all the bottles you need right <a href="https://www.myessentiallife.ca/collections/glass-bottles-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE.</a>  No oils?  Well that’s not a problem either!!

<span>Our school ski trip was yesterday and we had an amazing day. All three of my kids love going. This was my 6 year old's second time skiing and he rocked it....besides going on the chair lift with Mom and Dad and not getting off at the end and having to be lifted down....I guess he didn't realize that when we told him 10 times on the way up the lift that he would have to stand up and get off, that he would <strong><em>actually</em></strong> have to stand up and get off!! This only happened once of course because after that my husband and I made sure we had his arm to drag him off with us.</span>

Shake well and pump one to two pumps in your hands, rub together and run through your child's hair to deter lice.<br><br>Preventative tips to avoid getting lice on your school ski trip;</p>
<ol>
<li>Put a little Lice Be Gone in your child's hair and on their shoulders the morning of.</li>
<li>When trying on multiple helmets make sure you have a toque on! If its too warm for a toque add some extra Lice Be Gone to their hair and cross your fingers and toes!!</li>
<li>After you hand in your helmet do NOT stuff the toque back in the bag with the rest of the jackets and toques but place it in a plastic bag and tie shut. Either wash it when you get home or leave it in the bag for 48 hours. You can also toss the bag in the freezer overnight!</li>
<li>Check through your child's hair, just to be sure. A quick check takes less time then having to treat them and wash all the bedding in your house!!</li>

      <![CDATA[What does success mean to you? Do you define success in dollar amounts or in how happy you are??<p><a class="read-more" href="https://www.myessentiallife.ca/blogs/news/no-nonsense-what-it-means-to-be-a-small-business-owner">More</a></p>]]>
    </summary>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p name="accd" class="graf graf--p">No Nonsense— What it means to be a small business owner</p>
<figure name="02ce" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft" style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*j8WT2i-faglMAPBD-7oW2Q.png" style="float: none;"></figure>
<p name="af75" class="graf graf--p">When people ask me what I do for a living my answers are always the same, “my husband I farm and I have a hair salon in my house….oh….and I am co-owner of an online store.” Why do I answer like this? I’m not ashamed of our store, but I always feel that I’m being measured by how “successful” the store is.</p>
<p name="5446" class="graf graf--p">Our store, <a href="https://www.myessentiallife.ca" data-href="https://www.myessentiallife.ca" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">My Essential Life</a>, has been up and running for just over a year now. Is it successful, you ask? Define success — “the fact of getting or achieving wealth respect or fame” (Websters dictionary)</p>
<p name="2ab0" class="graf graf--p">If I have to define success by Websters definition, which many people do, then I guess I would have to say no our business is not successful. But maybe, I should check out different definitions of success. The late Zig Ziglar, argued that “True success has more components than one sentence or idea can contain.” So let’s redefine success!</p>
<p name="00c7" class="graf graf--p">Success —<br> believing you can; <br>always doing your best; <br>overcoming your fears;<br>learning something new everyday;<br>“If you can dream it you can achieve it;”<br> “You don’t have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great.”</p>
<p name="9f6d" class="graf graf--p">With definitions like that then yes our business is very successful! It’s hard though to keep these new definitions of success in mind when people question you on “how the store is doing” because my first thought always flies back to the Webster definition. Oh yeah, they want to know how much profit we are making and I instantly get defensive. I’m only defensive in my mind though!</p>
<p name="dbb6" class="graf graf--p">What needs to be done? “Success must never be measured by how much money you have.” Stop believing that success is measured in wealth and start believing that success stems from believing in yourself and in what you stand for.</p>
<p name="30c5" class="graf graf--p">What do you do for a living? — “I’m co-owner of <a href="https://www.myessentiallife.ca" data-href="https://www.myessentiallife.ca" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">My Essential Life</a>, an online store specializing in essential oil accessories and supplies.”</p>
<p name="fb54" class="graf graf--p">Oh yeah? How’s that going for you? — “It’s going great, we are now in the top 14% of all other Shopify stores that opened the same time as us! I’m so excited for how the store is growing and can’t wait to see what this year brings for us!”</p>
<p name="a5c1" class="graf graf--p">Changing that one response and thinking positively are going to make such a difference and I encourage you to think the same way! Don’t measure your success in dollars, “it’s not what you’ve got but what you use that makes a difference.”</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<h2>As a mom, I know we need organization and efficiency...and I also know what we get is chaos and frantic rushing out the door!  Wouldn’t it be awesome if you were prepared and had some control right at your finger tips??  Well, I’m here to let you know that is right within your grasp!</h2>
<p>We all want to keep our kids healthy, and I love to do that with Essential Oils.  My house has oils all over...belly blend in the kitchen, stuffy nose blend in Elle’s room, Cedar wood on Sophia’s dresser, InTune on Nick’s desk, and definitely Vetiver on my nightstand.  Chaos right??  NO MORE!  I’m taking a stand!</p>
<p>Carrying Cases to the rescue!  I’m going to grab a case and throw in all the necessities.  No more running around in the middle of the night looking for Breathe because all the oils are in the same spot!!</p>
<p>If I can organize my oils at home, why not on the go too?!! I can throw a smaller case in my purse.  All the oils I need on the go are right at my finger tips!  No more searching to the bottom deep depths of my purse in search of the belly blend, when I look in the rear-view mirror and see my kids are green with car sickness.   </p>
<p>As I sit back feeling pretty proud of my brilliance in organizational skills, I think I need to reward myself. I know! I need an aromatherapy necklace to throw my favourite blend on.  Calm mom, calm kids right!?  I need something to hold it together all day long!  For the kids sake!</p>

    <title>Lost Your Happy Heart? Get it Back Now!!</title>

      <![CDATA[<h2>February is supposed to be the happy heart month....but not everyone feels this way. </h2>
<p> As a Social Worker I am tasked with the care of heavy hearts every day.  Sometimes we....and I mean all of us when I say we....can bring ourselves down with our negative thinking patterns. </p>
<p>Ever get caught up in the old song playing in your head? Those nasty lyrics belting out the tune...”I’m not good enough, I’ll never be enough, I can’t handle it, and I’m such a failure”...nasty nasty thoughts! </p>
<p>Hey, we have all been there...if you say you haven’t had those thought pop into your beautiful heads....I’m gonna call you on that fib!!</p>
<p>Well I’m here to tell you that you have the power and control to challenge those negative patterns and create more realistic and positive thoughts!  </p>
<p>Change your tune...rewrite your lyrics.  Instead of....."I can’t handle it", sing...."it’s tough right now but if I do one thing at a time I will get it all done"...  Or instead of "I’m a failure"....sing a note of “I’m not perfect and I don’t need to be, I’m only human after all.”  Now doesn’t that feel better???   </p>
<p>On my journey of learning how to challenge thinking patterns I have some beautiful essential oils with me. My favourites are Doterra’ s Balance and Forgive blends.  Balance, to me feels like a stroll in the forest with its sweet notes of Ho Wood, Frankincense, Blue Tansy and Blue Chamomile.  Forgive, is another must for me with the beautiful fragrances of Spruce, Bergamot, Juniper Berry, Myrrh, Arborvitae, Nootka, Thyme and Citronella to set my heart on the right path. </p>
<p>So in February and for the rest of the year find balance in your thinking, forgive yourself and take back your happy heart!! </p>
<p>- Your Prairie Girl, </p>
<p>Erin</p>

<p>Well the majority of us are looking for the spice, cuz lets face it, spicy is always better than bland. </p>
<p>What is your Valentine's Day consist of? Mine - well I'm gonna enjoy my cup of coffee from 6-7 and then get my kids up for school. I have a salon in my house so I am booked with a color in the morning - next off to school where I will be volunteering to supervise for the Teachers because....hey did you know it's teacher appreciation week! Then back home to do a few more haircuts before kids get home from school. Once my kids step off the bus I have 7 mins to get them into the car and leave for gymnastics - get home from gym at 8:45!</p>
<p>Now where is there time in the day for spicy thoughts! if you've had a long day and you need to spice it up this Valentines Day here is a list of essential oils which are natural aphrodisiacs.</p>
<p><strong>Aphrodisiac Essential Oils</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ylang Ylang Essential Oil</li>
<li>Neroli Essential Oil</li>
<li>Clary Sage Essential Oil</li>
<li>Jasmine Essential Oil</li>
<li>Sweet Fennel Essential Oil</li>
<li>Rose Essential Oil</li>
</ul>
<p>What if your day has been to long?? Maybe you want to save those spicy oils for tomorrow night and use an aphrodisi-don't! </p>

    <title>Recharge This January with Essential Oil Blends</title>
    <author>
      <name>Angela Bley</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<h2>January - Refresh Recharge Renew with Essential Oil Blends</h2>
<p>Is anyone else feeling a little lost this January?? I sure am! It seems like I still have a million things to finish up from last year, and now I have a million things to start for this year! It makes my head spin!</p>
<p>Last week was a crazy week, so many tasks to complete and not knowing which one should take priority!</p>
<ul>
<li>Should I finish this up?</li>
<li>Maybe I should start on that?</li>
<li>No, I need to make this quick phone call first?</li>
<li>Write a blog??</li>
<li>Ugh whatever I'm not getting anything accomplished anyway so I might as well fold laundry!</li>
</ul>
<p>I was feeling a tad bit overwhelmed until we met with the beautiful Heather Pinay of <a href="http://authentically.ca" target="_blank" title="Authentically Yours - Marketing and Branding" rel="noopener noreferrer">Authentically </a>, who by the way people is freaken AMAZING, to map out our marketing plan for 2018. Not only did she help map out our goals and marketing for 2018 but she also mapped out a schedule for me right down to when I should throw a load of laundry in! </p>
<p>My feet feel firmly planted on the ground and I'm ready to tackle all my tasks! The key to planning tasks is to write a list of what you want to accomplish and block out time to get it done - that and a little help from my friends!</p>
<p>First things first, I need a little focus. Out come my essential oils to mix myself up such a focus blend!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">My Essential Life Focus Blend:</h2>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: center;">
<div style="text-align: left;">Peppermint Essential Oil (20 drops)</div>
</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">
<div>Wild Orange Essential Oil (20 drops)</div>
</li>
<li>
<div style="text-align: left;">Frankincense Essential Oil (10 drops)</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1253/1153/files/Headache_Blend_1_large.png?v=1516634831" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Save or pin this image for later!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mix this blend up in our pretty <a href="https://www.myessentiallife.ca/collections/glass-bottles-1/products/10-ml-blue-frosted-rollerbottle" target="_blank" title="Essential Oil Supplies &amp; Accessories" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frosted Blue Rollerbottles</a> and you will have my favorite Focus Blend. Apply to your wrists, neck and temples throughout the day to keep you focused on the task at hand! CAUTION - Do NOT roll on your temples before you workout - sweat, eyes, burning...you get the picture! Have squirley kids? Make a second blend to pack in their backpacks. Our rollerbottles come in six packs - so you can mix up your favorites for everyone and be on a roll.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.myessentiallife.ca/collections/glass-bottles-1/products/10-ml-blue-frosted-rollerbottle" target="_blank" title="10 ml blue rollerbottles" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1253/1153/files/Canadian-essential-oil-supplies-15_medium.jpg?v=1517350517" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></a></p>
<p>Whether your head is spinning or not, writing lists and making achievable goals topped with the support of essential oils will help you get more done as you wrap up the busy month of January. While we are at it, we want to know if you have any tips for us on how you stay focused - with essential oil recipes or practical tips and tricks!</p>
